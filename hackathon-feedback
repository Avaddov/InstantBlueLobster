Lobster

Excellent blue lobster. I LOVED IT!
I think the css is super cool. Looks like you really know your css !
I would however would appreciate some more javascript next time as you've already learnt conditionals, loops, 
functions and dom manipulation.
I also think that you should try and think of useful projects.
Not that im saying anything bad about yours, I just think that in our field what seperates good and great 
developers in constantly thinking of tools that can be used to make life easier !
Thanks for the laugh and again amazing css job.
